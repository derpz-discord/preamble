\DeclareFactoid{differentiable}{
If $f$ is differentiable at $c$ then the derivative of $f$ at $c$ is given by
    \begin{align*}
        f'(c) = \lim_{x \to c}\frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c}
    \end{align*}

\DeclareFactoid{amazingNotation}{
Please do not use notation that looks like this:

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $\mathrm{P} \notin \overline{P}$, then $\exists C_{\textrm{P}}$ such that $\textrm{P} \in C_\textrm{P}$ and $C_\textrm{P} \cap P = \emptyset$.
Clearly, $\overline{P}^{C} = \cup_{\textrm{P} \in \overline{P}^{C}} C_{\textrm{P}}$. Obviously, the union of open sets is open, so $\overline{P}^{C}$ is open.
\end{proof}
